1l## Task 3

## Intructions

- Your goal is to have a race between 2 different GIFs that will occur everytime the user clicks on a button. The 2 GIFs are already in the "/images" folder.

1. Start by creating the animation(s) for the GIFs to move across the screen

2. Using JS create a reference for the button, and set up the onclick button

3. The 2 GIFs that are racing should be assigned random speeds so that it is a fair race, think about how you can make the animation faster
